            <p>Alessandro Caruso, ACA+I’s co-founder, suffered an almost fatal motorbike crash in 1994 and spent 6 months confined to a hospital bed, in a miserable, noisy, clinical environment. Upon full recovery and grateful for the second chance, Alex was inspired and promised himself to improve any building environment for any user group, through his designs.</p>
            <p>ACA+I is a design-led practice that promotes environmental and sustainable design.</p>
            <p>Learning about our Clients’ priorities and research is crucial to our design approach, which is based on continuous learning and innovation.</p>

              <p>Amelia graduated with a BA (Hons) in Law &amp; Business in 1996. At the start of her career, she taught Business English in global companies and government ministries in Spain and Italy, where she mastered both languages. Over the years, she has accumulated extensive experience teaching adults in both public and private organisations in the UK and managed her own small business teaching Italian to adults.</p>
              <p>As the wife of an Architect whose work is his hobby, it has been impossible not to become interested and involved in design and Amelia has always enjoyed contributing to many of Alex’s projects and supporting Alex with bid writing. It made sense to create the fusion of two completely opposite, yet complementary individuals to form a company together and so ACA+I was set up.</p>
              <p>Amelia’s people and communication skills encourage an empathetic relationship with ACA+I’s staff and Clients. Amelia’s role is to ensure that the Practice runs smoothly on a day-to-day basis and she looks after ACA+I’s finance, administration, business development and HR.</p>
              <p>Amelia shares Alex’s passion to develop the Practice and above all to ensure that ACA+I’s Clients are well looked after.</p>
              <p>In Amelia’s spare time, she sings in a choir, studies classical singing, keeps fit and likes to read about and experiment with natural remedies.</p>
