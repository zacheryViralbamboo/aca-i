              <p><img src="uploads/images/fernbank_2.jpg"></p><p>ACA+I is thrilled with the finished results of its interior design scheme for the new-build Extra Care development by Abbeyfield, a specialist provider of later-life accommodation. The site is located on the former Bingley Hospital site in West Yorkshire. The scheme comprises of 49 Extra Care flats, 30 Dementia rooms and a community hub for the residents and the wider community to utilise Abbeyfield’s amenities. The brief was to create a high-quality, homely environment that residents will enjoy and feel proud to invite the community into and first impressions have been outstanding!</p><p>As designers, we believe in creating a building characterized by high-quality design, suitable for the users’ group and the need for progressive care and privacy.  Careful consideration was given to the challenges associated with a residential care environment such as activities related to daily living; cognition; behaviour and communication.</p><p>“I would like to thank ACA+I for the magnificent interior design and artwork which is proudly displayed on the walls of Fern House. I am so grateful that you took time to listen to what we needed to create a meaningful environment for people who are living with the early onset of dementia.   The feedback from our team who have been in the building for training has been overwhelmingly positive!  We have also taken pictures and shown our residents here at Grove House and they are very impressed, which was very pleasing to hear. </p><p> So thanks again for taking the extra time to provide us with what we need.  It was much appreciated.” Nicola Taylor – Head of Care Services. </p><p>See more pictures <a href="http://www.aca-i.com/projects/fernbank-extra-care-bingley">here</a>.</p>			</div>
