0.1.5 Settled down on Git & documentation added; bug fixes

0.1.6 Optimised Sass; cleaned up from pre-historic CodeKit Age; updated greyscale to tints of hightlight color and shadow.

0.2.0 Optimisation of file structure, preparing for Angular JS. TypeScript included in gulp. EditorConfig included. Bower added into .gitigore. Basic documentation structure under .\\docs.
